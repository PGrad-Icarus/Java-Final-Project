# Java-Final-Project
A repo of my final project in CS990, Object-Oriented Programming in Java
The Student Information System is a college records system that manages registration of students and professors, creation and
scheduling of courses and enrollment of students in courses.
  -Records are stored in a MySQL database in a remote AWS RDS instance.
  -The Java GUI front end desktop client allows for creating and updating records and is automatically
   synced with changes to tables and records in the database.
